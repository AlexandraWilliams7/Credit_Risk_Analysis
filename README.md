# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview 
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to work with Supervised Machine Learning. While conducting the analysis, the following tools were used:
- Scikit Learn
- Random Over Sampler
- SMOTE Oversampling
- ClusterCentroids (UnderSampling)
- SMOTEENN (over and under sampling)
- Balanced Random Forest Classifier
- Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier
### Results
Six machine learning algorithms were ran on the data. The balanced accuracy, precision, and recall will be recorded for each of the algorithms. 
1. **RandonOverSample**
